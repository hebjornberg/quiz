<b>Options and Next Question</b>

When faced with the questions, you have three options. If the user hasn't chosen an option, it won't be possible to move on to the next question. This was tested by choosing an option and moving to the next question, as well as trying to click on the "Next Question"-button without choosing an option.

For every question there is a 30 second time limit. If an option hasn't been chosen before the time is up, the application moves on to the next question, regardless if you have chosen an answer or not.

When finishing the quiz, your result will show up in the form of "You got x out of 11". Underneath is the button "Show Correct Answers". When clicked, the correct answers will appear. If you have chosen the correct answer to a question, only the black tick will appear indicating that you got the correct answer. If you have chosen the incorrect answer, a red cross indicates which answer you choose, along with the black tick indicating the correct option. 

<b>Time Taken</b>

Underneath all the options is the "Time taken" which indicates how long it took the user to complete the quiz. 

<b>Back To Start</b>

If the user would want to retake the quiz, there is a button at the bottom of the application that will redirect the user back to the landing page.
